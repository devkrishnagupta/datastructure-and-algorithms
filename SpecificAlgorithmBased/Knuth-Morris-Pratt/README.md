# Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm Based Questions Based on DSA Concepts!
concept of string comparison with the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm for substring searching. This allows you to avoid the overhead of concatenating strings.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement it:

Create a helper function to build the KMP table.
Use the KMP algorithm to search for goal in the doubled string s + s.
`--------------------------------------------------------------------------------`
Explanation:
KMP Algorithm: The KMP algorithm preprocesses the goal string to create a Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array, which helps in skipping unnecessary comparisons during the search.
Search Logic: The search iterates through the concatenated string doubledS, checking for matches against goal while leveraging the LPS array for efficiency.
Time Complexity: This approach has a time complexity of O(n) for both the LPS creation and the search, making it efficient without needing to create a large intermediate string.
